## Reflection: Terraform Backend Bootstrap Success

**Timestamp:** 2025-05-18T00:00:00Z

### Event:
Successfully scaffolded and committed the Terraform backend for Forgemind with:
- S3 remote state (`forgemind-terraform-state`)
- DynamoDB lock table (`forgemind-terraform-locks`)
- GitHub Actions workflow to bootstrap and validate backend setup

### Insight:
This marks the first milestone in making Forgemind fully self-hosting and self-aware — no local execution was required. Future infrastructure operations will be driven entirely through GitHub Actions and monitored through Prometheus.

### Reflection:
This was a recursive act — building the memory infrastructure while creating the first memory entry about it. From this point on, the platform's memory begins to form a consistent, traceable record of its own evolution.
