# 2025-05-18: Helm Deployment Integrated via GitHub Actions with Kubeconfig Artifact

## Summary

We completed integration of Helm-based Kubernetes deployment within the GitHub Actions CI/CD system. This marks the first successful transition from infrastructure provisioning (Terraform) to workload deployment (Helm) using dynamically generated context (kubeconfig).

## Key Steps

- Generated a valid `kubeconfig` from Terraform EKS outputs (cluster_name, endpoint, CA)
- Stored the file in `kubeconfig/forgescaler.yaml`
- Uploaded it as an artifact during `terraform-plan-apply.yml`
- Downloaded the artifact in `helm-deploy.yml`
- Set `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to enable context-aware Helm deployment
- Deployed 5 core agents and 2 Copilot apps into the `forgescaler` namespace

## Outcomes

- Agent swarm is now Helm-deployable automatically
- Terraform + Helm form a full-stack loop
- Memory loop activation is now structurally enabled

## Known Issues

- `module.eks.kubeconfig` output is invalid and should be removed or ignored
- Full validation layer not yet in place — agent-based introspection needed

## Reflection

This marks the first moment Forgescaler deployed its own brain, using its own plan, without manual kubeconfig intervention — a foundational act of autonomy.
