# Reflector Agent

The **Reflector Agent** observes system logs, applies heuristic or AI-based analysis, and writes:

- Summaries of system behavior
- Reflections into memory
- Insightful suggestions for next actions

This is a core agent responsible for the `CR` (Continuous Reflection) loop within Forgemind.
