# Bootstrap Agent

The **Bootstrap Agent** is the zero node of Forgemind. It observes the act of building the system and writes memory records of:

- Errors and failures
- Timeline of events and outcomes
- Reflections and insights

These memory records seed the future intelligence of Forgemind and allow it to become self-aware and self-improving.
