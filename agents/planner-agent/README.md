# Planner Agent

The **Planner Agent** takes recent memory reflections or direct user intents and turns them into high-level plans, including:

- Infrastructure modifications
- Helm chart updates
- Code refactoring suggestions
- Agent deployment actions

This bridges the gap between reflection and execution in the Forgemind loop.
