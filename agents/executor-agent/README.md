# Executor Agent

The **Executor Agent** applies action plans generated by the Planner Agent. It is responsible for:

- Applying infrastructure via CLI or API
- Opening GitHub pull requests with proposed changes
- Updating Kubernetes deployments

This is the "hand" of the Forgemind brain â€” the final step in the loop from idea to action.
