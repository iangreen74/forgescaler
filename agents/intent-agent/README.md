# Intent Agent

The **Intent Agent** is the entry point for human interaction with Forgemind. It is responsible for:

- Parsing natural language prompts
- Generating structured intent objects
- Triggering downstream planning and reflection loops

Eventually this agent will be powered by advanced LLMs, but even now it seeds the system's ability to understand and act on user ideas.
