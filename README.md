# 🧠 ForgeScaler — The Reflexive DevOps Fabric

**ForgeScaler** is a self-reflecting, AI-augmented DevOps platform that transforms raw ideas into fully deployed, continuously evolving cloud systems.

> Think of it as a recursive nervous system for your software — one that builds, monitors, corrects, and evolves itself.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

ForgeScaler provides:

- 🧠 **AI-powered CI/CD/CR:** Create → Deploy → Reflect
- 📦 **Terraform + Helm orchestration**
- 🕸️ **Reflex agents** that watch infrastructure, code, and memory
- 🔒 **Lock-aware infrastructure intelligence** (coming soon)
- 📚 **Immutable memory** stored in `.jsonl` and `.md` for transparency
- 🔁 **Recursive review and drift correction** powered by LLMs

## 🗂️ Project Structure

| Folder     | Purpose                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `infra/`   | Terraform modules (EKS, S3, Route53, IAM…)   |
| `charts/`  | Helm charts for agents and apps              |
| `agents/`  | Reflective AI components (intent, executor…) |
| `scripts/` | CI tools: layout validator, reviewers        |
| `memory/`  | Bootstrap logs + generated memory            |
| `.aiops/`  | Triagers, handlers, embeddings, schema       |

## 🌍 Vision

ForgeScaler is not just automation. It’s cognition.

We believe:

- Infra should write and review itself.
- Memory should evolve alongside code.
- Every deployment should be part of a recursive learning loop.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [x] Canonical structure enforcement via `project-layout.json`
- [x] AI-powered PR reviews + terraform plan validation
- [ ] Lock detection & memory logging
- [ ] Visual dashboards for memory + state evolution
- [ ] One-click bootstrap from plain English intent
