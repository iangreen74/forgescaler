# ForgeScaler

**An AI-Native Operating System for Autonomous AI Infrastructure**

> From Raspberry Pi to NVIDIA H200 to quantum compute.  
> Built to orchestrate AI workloads with memory, agents, and full-stack automation.

## 🧠 What is ForgeScaler?

**ForgeScaler** is a recursive, memory-powered DevOps operating system that automates the deployment and operation of AI-native infrastructure — from single GPU nodes to full-scale data centers.

It powers [VaultScaler](https://vaultscaler.com) — a boutique, air-gapped AI data center for secure inference and lightweight model fine-tuning.

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🤖 **Agent-Oriented Architecture**  
  Modular AI agents handle planning, execution, and introspection across infrastructure.

- 🧬 **Recursive Memory System**  
  Every change is reflected, analyzed, and remembered — forming a long-term operational memory.

- ☁️ **Cloud-Native and Bare-Metal Ready**  
  Deployable on EKS, Raspberry Pi clusters, H200 servers, or secure on-prem environments.

- 📈 **AI-Driven Observability**  
  Memory visualizations, real-time dashboards, lock tracking, and reflective automation.

- 🛠️ **Full Infrastructure-as-Code Pipeline**  
  Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions — pre-integrated and automation-first.

🚀 Quick Start

git clone https://github.com/iangreen74/forgescaler.git
cd forgescaler
make bootstrap


🔒 Use Cases
Launch a private inference node from your apartment using air-gapped H200 hardware

Deploy Raspberry Pi swarms with agent-based coordination and memory

Simulate multi-tenant secure AI environments using Kubernetes

Power the backend of a commercial AI hosting service with full observability


📚 Philosophy
ForgeScaler is built on the idea that infrastructure should think.
It should reflect, learn, adapt, and grow. Every component in this repo contributes to a recursive, memory-based model of computing.

AI shouldn't just run in your stack.
It should be your stack.

🧠 Roadmap Highlights
 Agent-based modular architecture

 Memory logs, schema, and dashboard

 Terraform + Helm + GitHub CI/CD pipelines

 Multi-GPU fine-tuning controller

 GPU-aware workload queue
