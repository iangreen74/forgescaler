# ForgeScaler

**An AI-Native Operating System for Autonomous AI Infrastructure**

From Raspberry Pi to NVIDIA H200 — ForgeScaler is designed to orchestrate secure AI workloads with memory-driven agents, full-stack observability, and fully automated DevOps workflows.

---

## 🧠 What is ForgeScaler?

ForgeScaler is a **recursive, memory-powered DevOps operating system** for deploying and managing AI-native infrastructure — from edge devices to GPU clusters and beyond.

It serves as the core software layer behind [VaultScaler](https://vaultscaler.com), a boutique AI data center designed for **air-gapped inference**, **lightweight model fine-tuning**, and **tenant-grade AI automation**.

ForgeScaler automates provisioning, self-reflects on its own operations, and evolves through intelligent agents and persistent memory — allowing infrastructure to **think**, **adapt**, and **scale itself**.

## 🔧 Core Features

- 🤖 **Agent-Based Architecture**  
  Modular agents handle bootstrapping, planning, orchestration, and memory reflection.

- 🧬 **Recursive Memory System**  
  Every Terraform apply, drift, failure, or anomaly is reflected into structured logs, visualized via dashboards, and used to improve future deployments.

- 📦 **End-to-End Infrastructure as Code**  
  Fully integrated with Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes, Prometheus, GitHub Actions, and AI-powered validation tools.

- 🌐 **Multi-Environment Support**  
  Works across edge devices (Raspberry Pi), cloud Kubernetes (EKS), and bare-metal H100/H200 servers.

- 📈 **AI-Augmented Observability**  
  Realtime dashboards, memory triage, lock tracking, and reflective drift analysis.

- 🧰 **Self-Repair and Self-Insight**  
  Designed to detect and analyze infrastructure issues before they cause failures.

🚀 Use Cases
🖥️ Spin up a self-debugging GPU node from your apartment using a single H200 or Pi

🔒 Launch air-gapped inference environments for privacy-conscious clients

🧠 Run tenant-based AI workloads with isolation and observability

🌍 Create a decentralized AI hosting network built on self-provisioning hardware

🛤️ Roadmap
 Agent-based bootstrap and memory layer

 Terraform + Helm + EKS automation

 Lock tracking, drift detection, memory logging

 Copilot dashboard and AI workflow review

 GPU workload queueing and tenant provisioning

 Lightweight fine-tuning pipelines (LoRA, adapters)

 High-trust service mesh (gRPC + token auth)

 Quantum abstraction layer (long-term research)

💡 Philosophy
We believe infrastructure should not just run workloads — it should learn from them.

ForgeScaler brings together principles of automation, intelligence, and evolution into one recursive DevOps platform.

Inspired by nature, cognition, and distributed systems — ForgeScaler is designed for founders and engineers who want sovereign control over AI infrastructure.

🔭 Looking Ahead
While our current focus is on GPUs and secure multi-tenant orchestration, ForgeScaler is designed to evolve with emerging compute paradigms — including quantum — as they become practically viable.
