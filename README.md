## 🧠 What is ForgeScaler?

**ForgeScaler** is a recursive, memory-powered DevOps operating system for deploying AI-native infrastructure — whether on a single GPU node or across a distributed data center.

It automates everything: provisioning, monitoring, and stores all events that are used as a detabase for future troubleshooting with AI.

This project powers [VaultScaler](https://vaultscaler.com) — a boutique, air-gapped AI data center currently under development in Las Vegas, Nevasa. Vaultscaler will be offering boutique. security conscious inference and lightweight fine-tuning for privacy-conscious clients.
