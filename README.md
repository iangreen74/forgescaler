# ForgeScaler

**A Control Plane for AI-Native Infrastructure Automation**

ForgeScaler is an open-source system for automating the provisioning, orchestration, and introspection of AI infrastructure environments. It uses agent-based workflows and a persistent memory system to deploy, monitor, and evolve machine learning infrastructure over time.

Built for DevOps and MLOps engineers working with GPUs, Kubernetes, and secure inference workloads.

---

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Memory-Aware DevOps**  
  Persistent structured logs, cognitive reflections, and drift analysis to improve infrastructure over time.

- 🤖 **Modular Agent Architecture**  
  Intelligent agents coordinate bootstrapping, planning, execution, and runtime introspection.

- 🔧 **Infrastructure-as-Code by Default**  
  Native integration with Terraform and Helm. Declarative, auditable, and reproducible deployments.

- 📈 **AI-Augmented CI/CD**  
  GitHub Actions for plan/apply pipelines, lock detection, AI-driven validation, and workflow audit trails.

- ☁️ **GPU-Aware Orchestration**  
  Prepares infrastructure for inference, lightweight fine-tuning, and secure, tenant-grade workloads.

Use Cases
Automate the provisioning of GPU-backed Kubernetes environments for AI workloads

Integrate self-reflecting infrastructure into existing DevOps CI/CD workflows

Monitor drift and deployment history using memory-based observability tools

Launch multi-tenant inference and model-serving infrastructure with built-in automation

Roadmap
 Memory schema, reflection system, and dashboard

 Agent-based bootstrapping and deployment pipeline

 GitHub CI/CD with AI review and drift validation

 GPU workload queueing and fine-tuning orchestration

 Secure multi-tenant provisioning

 Deployment packaging and service mesh integration


 Philosophy
ForgeScaler treats infrastructure as an evolving system — one that can observe itself, remember what went wrong, and improve continuously.

ForgeScaler blends DevOps automation with introspection to support secure, production-grade AI systems.


Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/iangreen74/forgescaler.git
cd forgescaler
make bootstrap
Then apply infrastructure and deploy agents using Terraform + Helm.
